      "I've had a crush on my best friend for years. I hope they never find out. Every time we hang out, I feel this weird mix of joy and guilt, like I'm hiding something huge. I don’t want to ruin our friendship, but I also wish I could be honest. It’s hard pretending these feelings don’t exist. Maybe one day I’ll move on, or maybe things will change, but until then… it’s my secret to carry.",
